# Frontend Directory Consolidation - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully consolidated duplicate frontend directories into a single source of truth.

## Actions Taken

### 🔍 Analysis Results
- **Two directories found**: `client/` and `frontend/`
- **Structure**: Both contained identical file structures and components
- **Timestamps**: `frontend/` directory had more recent modifications (newer by ~4 minutes)
- **Configuration**: Vite config was already pointing to `frontend/` as the root directory

### ✅ Consolidation Decision
- **Primary directory**: `frontend/` (kept as single source of truth)
- **Removed directory**: `client/` (duplicate, older timestamps)
- **Reason**: `frontend/` had more recent files and was already configured as the Vite root

### 🔧 Changes Made
1. **Verified file integrity**: Compared both directories - confirmed identical content
2. **Removed duplicate**: Deleted `client/` directory completely
3. **Maintained configuration**: No changes needed to Vite config (already pointed to `frontend/`)
