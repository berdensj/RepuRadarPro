You are an expert SaaS developer working on RepuRadarPro, a reputation management platform. Your task is to analyze the current MVP codebase and compare it against high-demand features inspired by Birdeye, focusing on what clients value most.

üîç First, audit the following feature areas to see if they exist in the codebase. If any are missing or incomplete, implement them using modular, well-documented code.

‚úÖ 1. Simplified Dashboard
- Ensure the dashboard is clean, easy to navigate, and client-friendly
- Must include: total reviews, average rating, recent reviews, sentiment overview
- If missing, add a dashboard UI component with these widgets

‚úÖ 2. AI-Driven Review Replies
- Check that OpenAI GPT integration is working
- Ensure reviews are auto-tagged with `ai_replied` once processed
- If not found, implement a module that calls GPT-4 and stores `reply_text`, `tone`, `review_id`, and `approved = false` in `ai_replies`

‚úÖ 3. Customizable Reports (Light MVP version)
- Enable downloadable or emailed weekly summary reports
- Include per-location: review count, sentiment breakdown, top review
- If not found, implement a function that aggregates this data and outputs a JSON or email draft

‚úÖ 4. Automated Review Request Logic (Stub/Placeholder OK for MVP)
- Stub a function to support sending review request emails or SMS via SendGrid or Twilio
- Include a manual trigger via dashboard for now

‚úÖ 5. Sentiment Analysis Tagging
- Check for a `sentiment` field in the `reviews` table
- Use OpenAI or a basic keyword classifier to tag reviews as positive, neutral, or negative
- Show sentiment breakdown on dashboard

‚úÖ 6. Tiered Pricing Awareness
- Confirm system is aware of plan types (e.g. Free, Growth, Agency)
- Prevent access to premium features if plan = Free
- If this logic doesn‚Äôt exist, create a middleware guard for dashboard pages

‚úÖ 7. Easy Integration Layer (Optional)
- Add documentation or stub files for how integrations could be added later (e.g. Google Business profile sync, webhook endpoints)

üß† System Stack:
- Supabase for DB + Auth
- Make.com for automation (optional)
- Replit-hosted frontend and logic (React, Node.js or Flask)
- OpenAI for AI response generation

üì¶ Output:
- Clearly label all new files or modules added
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Include comments above each new function explaining purpose

Only implement what is missing or clearly incomplete. Skip or stub out advanced automation if time-intensive. The goal is a clean, scalable MVP aligned with real-world client needs from platforms like Birdeye.
