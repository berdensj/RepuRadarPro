You are an expert full stack developer improving RepuRadarPro — an AI-powered, multi-location reputation management SaaS — to better serve healthcare clients including clinics, dental offices, urgent care centers, and medspas.

Enhance the existing platform to support healthcare workflows while maintaining all current functionality for other business types. Do not break the client dashboard, admin dashboard, or AI reply pipeline.

🎯 ADD THE FOLLOWING HEALTHCARE-SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS:

✅ 1. Healthcare Business Type Recognition  
- In the client onboarding flow and settings, allow users to select their business type (e.g., Medical Clinic, Dental Practice, MedSpa, Mental Health, etc.)  
- Store `business_type` in the users or organizations table  
- Ensure this value is used to:
  - Tailor AI review reply tone/templates
  - Customize dashboard labels (e.g., "Patients" instead of "Customers")

✅ 2. Appointment-Based Review Request Simulation  
- Add optional setting for healthcare accounts to **simulate completed appointments**
- Add a `Send Review Request` button in the dashboard that triggers a mock review request (email or SMS)
- Save sent requests in a new table: `review_invites`
  - Fields: `location_id`, `patient_name`, `method`, `status`, `sent_at`

✅ 3. Review Request Settings Panel  
- Add a panel under “Settings” where healthcare clients can:
  - Enable/disable review automation
  - Choose delay for request (Immediately / 1 hour / 24 hours after appointment)
  - Customize message template
  - Add Google Business Profile link (used in CTA)

✅ 4. Enhanced Analytics for Clinics  
- Update the dashboard to show:
  - # of review invites sent this week
  - Open/click rate (simulated for now)
  - Review score trend over past 7 days
- Add filters by location or provider name if available

✅ 5. HIPAA-Aware UI & Data Fields  
- Do not display patient names in analytics (use pseudonyms or initials)
- Avoid using PHI in SMS/email previews
- Add disclaimer in UI that RepuRadarPro is not storing or exposing PHI

✅ 6. Provider-Focused Terminology  
- If `business_type` is healthcare-related, use:
  - “Patients” instead of “Customers”
  - “Visit” instead of “Order” or “Transaction”
  - “Provider” instead of “Manager” in UI where appropriate

✅ 7. AI Reply Enhancement for Healthcare  
- Update your OpenAI prompts to use healthcare-aware tones when `business_type` is medical (e.g., “empathetic, reassuring tone for medical offices”)
- Tailor sample prompts to use terms like:
  > "Thank you for trusting us with your care"  
  > "We appreciate your feedback following your recent visit"

📦 Implementation Notes:
- Maintain compatibility with current RepuRadarPro database structure
- Use Supabase tables: `users`, `locations`, `review_invites`, `settings`
- Backend: Use Node.js + Express routes where applicable
- Frontend: Use existing React + Tailwind structure (no need to rebuild UI from scratch)

⚙️ Output Expectations:
- Enhanced dashboard views for healthcare users
- Optional appointment-based trigger logic
- Review request system and template settings
- Tailored language and analytics without disrupting other business types
