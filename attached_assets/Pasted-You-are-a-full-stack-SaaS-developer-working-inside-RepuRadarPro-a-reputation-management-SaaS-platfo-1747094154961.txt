You are a full-stack SaaS developer working inside RepuRadarPro, a reputation management SaaS platform built in Replit.

Your task is to update the onboarding flow by adding a **“Business Type” (Client Type)** selection step so that new users can be categorized during signup.

---

## 🎯 GOAL
Create a new onboarding screen or step labeled **“What type of business do you manage?”** and display the following options as a dropdown menu or tile grid:

### Recommended Business Types:
1. Med Spa / Aesthetic Clinic  
2. Dental Office  
3. Home Services (Plumbing, HVAC, Roofing, etc.)  
4. Restaurant / Food Service  
5. Fitness Studio / Gym  
6. Real Estate Agent / Brokerage  
7. Marketing or Reputation Agency  
8. Other (with optional custom input field)

---

## 🔧 REQUIREMENTS

1. **Frontend:**
   - Add this step to the onboarding wizard after collecting name/email and before review source integration.
   - Display the options using a dropdown or radio-style button group.
   - If the user selects “Other,” show an optional text field for them to describe their business.
   - Add a “Next” button that validates a selection was made.

2. **Backend / Storage:**
   - Store the selected business type in the `business_profiles` or `clients` table as `client_type`.
   - If custom text is entered under "Other", store it as `client_type_custom`.

3. **Usage:**
   - This value should later be used to:
     - Customize AI tone settings
     - Tailor analytics views or templates
     - Segment users for future targeting or feature gating

4. **Design Notes:**
   - Keep the UI mobile-friendly and match the style of existing onboarding steps.
   - Add labels/tooltips for clarity if needed (e.g., “This helps us personalize your dashboard and responses”).

## BONUS (Optional):
- If the user selects **Agency**, set a flag `is_agency: true` in the database for role/feature toggling later.
- Leave a TODO comment for future logic that maps business type to AI tone preset.

Use clean, modular code. Update both the frontend flow and backend data model. After implementation, update the README.md to reflect this new onboarding step.
