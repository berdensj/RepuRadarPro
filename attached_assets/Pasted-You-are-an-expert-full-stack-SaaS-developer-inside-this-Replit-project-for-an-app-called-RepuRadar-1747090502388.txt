You are an expert full-stack SaaS developer inside this Replit project for an app called **RepuRadarPro**, an AI-powered reputation management platform. Your goal is to implement a complete **new user onboarding flow** for a 14-day free trial experience.

Please follow the steps below to create all necessary files, routes, UI screens, and data models using JavaScript (Node.js + HTML/CSS frontend) and Supabase for storage.

---

## STEP 1: USER ACCOUNT & TRIAL LOGIC
- Set up Firebase Auth or a custom JWT-based login system.
- Upon signup, store the user with:
  - `user_id`, `email`, `created_at`, `trial_start`, `trial_end` (set trial to expire in 14 days).
- Middleware to restrict access to dashboard features after trial ends (show upgrade prompt).

---

## STEP 2: ONBOARDING WIZARD SCREENS

### Screen 1: Welcome Page
- Show: “Welcome to RepuRadarPro — your 14-day trial has started!”
- Button: “Let’s get started” → navigates to Business Info page

### Screen 2: Business Info
- Form fields:
  - Business Name
  - Industry (dropdown)
  - Contact Name, Email, Phone
  - Logo Upload (optional)
- Save this to Supabase under `business_profiles`

### Screen 3: Add Location
- Allow multiple locations with fields:
  - Location Name
  - Address (Street, City, ZIP, State)
  - Location Email/Phone
- Save each location under the business account in `locations` table

### Screen 4: Connect Platforms
- Integration placeholder cards for:
  - Google My Business
  - Yelp
  - Facebook
- Each “Connect” button should save platform selection and mock connection for now (fake token ok)

### Screen 5: Set AI Preferences
- Toggle settings:
  - Default tone (Professional, Friendly, Apologetic)
  - Auto-reply to 5-star reviews (on/off)
  - Notification frequency (Instant, Daily, Weekly)
- Store this in a `preferences` table keyed by user or business

### Screen 6: Dashboard
- Show charts using Chart.js:
  - Sample review volume chart
  - Pie chart of sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
- List of recent reviews (use mock data if not integrated)
- AI-generated replies visible with Approve/Reject buttons

---

## BACKEND TASKS
- Set up Supabase tables:
  - `users`, `business_profiles`, `locations`, `preferences`, `reviews`, `responses`
- Connect OpenAI to `generateReply(reviewText, tone)` for AI reply generation
- Implement mock review loader (fake reviews per location) to populate dashboard

---

## FINAL TASKS
- Create a README.md summarizing:
  - Onboarding flow
  - How to test the 14-day trial
  - How Supabase and OpenAI are integrated
- Save all new components and link them together with clean routing logic

---

Now, begin auditing the project to determine which onboarding components already exist, then proceed to build any missing features using clean, modular code in new files. Use lightweight libraries only.
