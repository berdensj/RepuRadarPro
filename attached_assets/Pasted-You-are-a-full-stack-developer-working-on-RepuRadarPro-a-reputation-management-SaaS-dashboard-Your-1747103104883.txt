You are a full-stack developer working on RepuRadarPro, a reputation management SaaS dashboard. Your task is to upgrade the **sidebar navigation** based on the following modern SaaS UX recommendations.

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Improve the sidebar’s structure, role-awareness, and usability. Add support for active state highlights, responsive design, collapsible menu groups, icons, and user role filtering.

---

## 🔧 TASKS TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. ✅ **Add Icons to Sidebar Items**
- Use a consistent icon set like **Font Awesome**, **Lucide**, or **Heroicons**
- Example mappings:
  - Dashboard → 🏠
  - Reviews → 💬
  - Analytics → 📊
  - Reports → 📈
  - Settings → ⚙️
  - Admin Panel → 🛠️

---

### 2. ✅ **Active State Highlighting**
- Add visual feedback to show the current page (e.g., background highlight, left border, or bold icon)
- Highlight should persist based on current route or URL hash

---

### 3. ✅ **Collapsible Sidebar**
- Add a toggle icon (hamburger or arrow) to collapse/expand the sidebar
- When collapsed, show only icons with tooltips on hover
- Use localStorage or session state to remember sidebar state

---

### 4. ✅ **Group Items into Sections**
- Organize menu items into clear sections:
  - **Overview**
    - Dashboard
    - Reports
  - **Review Management**
    - Reviews
    - AI Replies
  - **Insights**
    - Analytics
  - **Account**
    - Settings
    - Billing
  - **Admin Tools** *(Admins only)*
    - User Management
    - Role Controls
    - Logs

---

### 5. ✅ **Role-Based Navigation**
- Filter sidebar items by user role (e.g., admin, manager, staff)
- Only show:
  - **Admin Tools** section to system or agency admins
  - **Billing** to owners
  - Hide advanced options from trial or Free Plan users if needed

---

### 6. ✅ **User Profile Block**
- At the bottom or top of the sidebar, show:
  - User avatar or initials
  - Business name or role
  - Logout button
  - Optional: Plan name or upgrade CTA

---

### 7. ✅ **Responsive Design**
- Make sidebar fully responsive:
  - On screens < 768px: collapse to hamburger menu
  - Add swipe-open drawer behavior for mobile
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA tags, keyboard nav)

---

### BONUS FEATURES (Optional)
- Notification badges on menu items (e.g., “3 unresponded reviews”)
- Search field at top to quickly jump to sections
- Dark mode toggle in user profile block

---

## 📁 STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
- Place sidebar logic in `/components/sidebar.js`
- Use a config-driven menu file (`sidebarConfig.js`) for dynamic rendering
- Apply styles in `sidebar.css` or using Tailwind if available

---

## ✅ FINAL STEP
After implementation:
- Test all routes and role filters
- Confirm active state reflects current page
- Update `README.md` with:
  - Sidebar role structure
  - Responsive behavior
  - Icon usage

Begin by reviewing the current sidebar file and apply each change in modular stages.
